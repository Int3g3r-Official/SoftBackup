### How does it work?

#### DEPENDENCIES

- googlesearch (pip3 install google-search)

#### BEFORE REINSTALL

- Before you reinstall your operating system you will launch "SoftBackup" and you will select the option -> Backup by typing backup or b.
- After it is finished you will find a new file named saved.txt
- Save that file on a flash drive or some online storage like onedrive or google drive.

#### AFTER REINSTALL
- Download the repo again.
- Place saved.txt file in the root folder (where source.py is).
- Run "SoftBackup" and type restore or r.
- Now your default web-browser will open and you will get all download pages for those apps.

### Why don't i just simply reinstall everything manually?

I think that it is easier to have 1 file saved than remembering all programs you had and you might just forget some if you have a lot of them.

## Thank you for checking out my repo.
## Currently only MACOSX is supported.
