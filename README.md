# SoftBackup

## How does it work?

### BEFORE REINSTALL

- Before you reinstall your operating system you will launch "SoftBackup" and you will select the option -> 1. Save.
- After it is finished you will find a new folder called output and inside that folder there will be a file named programs.txt.
- Save that file.

### AFTER REINSTALL
- Download the repo again.
- Make a folder called "Input" (Capital I) and place your programs.txt file there. (Or run softbackup and select restore which will create the folder.)
- Run "SoftBackup" and select restore.
- Now your default webbrowser will open and you will get all google search results for that app.

## Why don't i just simply reinstall everything manually?

I think that it is easier to have 1 file saved than remembering all programs you had and you might just forget some if you have a lot of them.

# Thank you for checking out my repo.
